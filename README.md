# Binary-Search-Algorithm-Class-Assigment

For this assignment, you were just hired as a junior software developer as part of a team of developers for a software contracting company. Your company has just won a big contract to develop a software application for the United States Department of Defense. The team lead has tasked you with developing a Java program that uses a binary search algorithm looking for the numbers 17 and 45 from an array. Because you do not have your secret clearance yet, a senior developer will later take your code and modify it for the requirements of the contract.

In this coding assignment you will utilize the Java syntax and techniques you learned while reviewing the required resources for Week 2. Include comments for each section of the program. You may select appropriate variable names as long as proper Java syntax is used. You will also submit your source code.

Input:
In the input section, you are to create a Java program that uses a binary search looking for the numbers 17 and 45 from an array. Since you are a junior developer, hard code the array as follows:
{5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70}

Processing:
In the processing section, use the appropriate Java syntax to perform the lookup.

Output:
Your display must include the following:

A prompt indicating if 17 was found
A prompt indicating if 45 was found
